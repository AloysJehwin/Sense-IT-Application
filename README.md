Smart Navigation System for Dual-Sensory Loss Individuals (Deaf & Blind) – Live Tracking and Monitoring Application

Overview

This project presents an innovative solution aimed at enhancing the independence and safety of individuals with dual sensory loss (deaf and blind) through a specially designed **Smart Headband**. The headband is equipped with multiple sensors to sense the environment, including obstacles, changes in surroundings, and directionality. The primary goal is to assist individuals in navigating safely by providing **tactile feedback** that informs them of their surroundings in real-time.

Alongside the headband, we developed a **Mobile Application** that serves as a live tracking and monitoring tool, offering caregivers and family members peace of mind by allowing them to follow the wearer's journey, monitor their status, and ensure their safety remotely.

Features of the Application

1. **Live Tracking and Location Monitoring**
- **Real-Time GPS Tracking**: The application provides real-time location data of the wearer via GPS. This helps caregivers or family members monitor their loved ones and receive live updates of their movements.
- **Location History**: Track the historical paths that the user has taken, helping to understand movement patterns and ensure routine safety.
  2. **Sensor Data Monitoring**
- The headband contains several environment-sensing sensors (e.g., proximity, temperature, humidity, etc.). The mobile application collects and visualizes this data to provide insights into the wearer's surroundings.
- **Obstacle Detection Alerts**: Whenever the sensors detect obstacles, the app logs these events, and a notification is sent to the caregiver, ensuring immediate action can be taken if necessary.

3. **Tactile Feedback Control**
- The app allows remote customization of tactile feedback sensitivity, enabling caregivers to adjust the feedback levels for different environmental settings (e.g., indoors, crowded areas, outdoor spaces).
- **Feedback Alerts**: When the wearer faces potential danger (e.g., sudden obstacles or unusual temperature levels), the application provides notifications, keeping the caregiver informed.

4. **Health Monitoring**
- The system integrates **basic health data**, such as heart rate and temperature monitoring. If abnormal health readings are detected, the app triggers alerts to the caregiver.
  
5. **Emergency Notifications and SOS Alerts**
- In case of an emergency (detected by a sudden stop, fall, or lack of movement), the wearer can trigger an **SOS alert** by tapping the headband or pressing a button on the app. 
- This feature sends a notification to the pre-configured emergency contacts with the current GPS location, enabling swift assistance.

6. **Customization and User-Friendly Interface**
- The app's interface is designed for ease of use, even for non-technical users. It provides customizable settings for managing the sensitivity and types of feedback (vibrations, sound, or light) the user receives.

Hardware – Smart Headband Details

The **Smart Headband** contains a range of sensors, including:
- **Proximity Sensors**: Detect nearby obstacles (walls, objects, etc.)
- **Infrared Sensors**: For nighttime navigation or low-light scenarios
- **Vibration Motors**: Provide real-time tactile feedback
- **Accelerometer and Gyroscope**: Detect head movements and orientation
- **GPS Module**: Tracks location and sends data to the mobile application
- **Health Sensors**: Measure vital signs like heart rate and body temperature
- **Battery**: Long-lasting, rechargeable battery optimized for daily usage

All these sensors communicate with the mobile application via Bluetooth, ensuring seamless real-time updates and feedback for both the wearer and caregiver.

Technology Stack

- **Mobile Application**: Built using **Java/Kotlin** for Android, with a user-friendly UI, integrated Google Maps API for GPS tracking, and Bluetooth connectivity for sensor data transfer.
- **Backend**: The app connects to a cloud server (e.g., **Firebase**) to store location history, user data, and provide real-time updates to caregivers.
- **Hardware**: The headband contains microcontrollers (such as **Arduino** or **Raspberry Pi**), paired with IoT sensors and modules to relay data to the app.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Managed using small **vibration motors** placed inside the headband at various locations. Vibration intensity and patterns change according to obstacle distance and direction.

How It Works

1. **Wearer Setup**: The wearer puts on the Smart Headband, which connects to the mobile application via Bluetooth.
2. **Sensor Activation**: The headband’s sensors scan the environment, continuously transmitting data to the mobile app.
3. **Tactile Feedback**: As the wearer navigates, they receive tactile feedback (vibration patterns) indicating obstacles, direction changes, or other environmental factors.
4. **Live Tracking**: Caregivers or family members use the app to monitor the wearer's live location and sensor data.
5. **Alerts and Notifications**: In case of emergencies, unusual events, or obstacles, the app sends notifications to pre-configured contacts.

Installation and Usage

For Wearers:
1. Download the app from the Play Store.
2. Pair the headband with the app via Bluetooth.
3. Customize the feedback settings to your preference.
4. Start navigating – the headband will provide real-time tactile feedback, and your movements will be tracked on the app.

For Caregivers:
1. Install the app and link it to the wearer’s headband and GPS system.
2. Monitor the wearer's real-time location and environment using the dashboard.
3. Set up emergency contacts and notification preferences.
4. Receive real-time alerts and logs when potential hazards or unusual activities are detected.
